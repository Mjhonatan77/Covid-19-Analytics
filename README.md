# Covid-19-Analytics




### Motivation
Predictive models, also known as predictive analytics, can help estimate the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and they can also help determine the impact of vaccines on the disease. It can also assist in forecasting the means needed to combat the pandemic, such as hospital patient beds and critical care unit beds, as well as supply needs, for example ventilators and personal protective equipment. Prediction models are valuable and can offer policymakers with important insights. To use predictive models appropriately as support and reference tools for COVID-19 planning and action, we must first comprehend the data.
In this work, we use data analysis, which is the process of gathering, modeling, and evaluating data, to extract insights that help decision-making regarding COVID-19 in a data collection from the 17 departments in Paraguay. The findings allow us to have a better understanding of how the illness affects the community. The primary goal of data analysis in this study is to find meaning in data so that the derived knowledge can be used to make informed decisions and optimize monitoring techniques in affected departments, which will be extremely beneficial to the government, health care workers, scientists, and others involved in comprehending the scale of the repercussions of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country in order to enhance government policies, choices, medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks, etc.),  and so on in order to minimize the number of infected and sick people. We display the data analysis findings from Jupyter Notebook on an interactive web page, using the extension Voil√†, that converts Jupyter notebooks into independent web applications.
